Hi! I am a first-year PhD student studying Information Science at the University of Colorado in Boulder. I am a&nbsp;researcher&nbsp;with the&nbsp;[Creative Communities Lab](https://www.creativecommunities.group/), led by Dr.&nbsp;[Ricarose Roque](http://ricarose.com/). We&nbsp;focus on creative,&nbsp;personally meaningful, and playful&nbsp;learning with technology in order to increase&nbsp;tech literacy for families and kids. Please visit my&nbsp;[projects page](https://jtruppert.github.io/blog/projects)&nbsp;to view an abbreviated&nbsp;list of my&nbsp;work.&nbsp;I graduated with a B.S. in Management Information Systems from the University of Alabama in 2018, and my&nbsp;hometown is New Orleans, Louisiana.
